What do you love about the future? If the future does not include being out there among the stars and being a multiplanet species, I find that incredibly depressing if that's not the future that we're going to have."</i></p>

				The realization that culture is critical to your company’s success is nothing new. All the way back in 2002 (ancient times, I know…), James Baron and Michael Hannan published the results of the eight year study of startup cultures called (Organizational Blueprints for Success in High-Tech Start-Ups: Lessons from the Stanford Project on Emerging Companies).
				The authors studied over 200 startups. The results of their study indicate that a startup’s culture has a massive impact on the probability of success. In fact, the culture choice of the company’s founders likely has the most impact on a company’s chances of success There are five types of culture that are prevalent in startups. They are:
				Star: “We recruit only top talent, pay them top wages, and give them the resources and autonomy they need to do their job.”
				Commitment: “I wanted to build the kind of company where people would only leave when they retire.”
				Bureaucracy: “We make sure things are documented, have job descriptions for people, project descriptions, and pretty rigorous project management techniques.”
				Engineering: “We were very committed. It was a skunk-works mentality and the binding energy was very high.”
				Autocracy: “You work, you get paid.”
				Do you want to get your company to some sort of liquidity event be it an IPO or a successful sale? Then, the Commitment culture is your best chance of success.
